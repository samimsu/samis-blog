          I made my first sale today. I used to be so scared to talk to people
          on the phone and still am, but I've been trying to seek out
          discomfort. I want to put myself in those situations because I truly
          believe that's where growth comes from. I'm already feeling the
          growth. I felt the confidence in the calls I made after that.
          Unfortunately, they didn't lead to sales, but it was good practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to be sincere and open with the customer. I don't want to
          manipulate them in any way. I don't want to talk up the product just
          to get a sale. I hope I'm not doing that. It's easy to get excited to
          get a sale, but I should consider if the product is good for the
          customer. I believe it is. I'm putting my faith in the company. So it
          was a much better day than yesterday. I walked a little before I went
          to work for some mental clarity. I kept practicing what I would say on
          my first call in my head ever since I left work the day before. I'll
          share what I wrote in my notes before I arrived at work today.

          I think that was helpful. It relieves the pressure of trying to make a
          perfect first call. It doesn't exist. A perfect sales pitch doesn't
          exist. I just wanted to try. I didn't care about failing. So when I
          was asked if I would like to start making calls, I said yes right
          away. I was hesitant inside, but the fact that I was asked meant
          something. It was sort of to test if I was ready. I didn't think I
          was. And if I wasn't, at least I'd learn. And I did. I was given
          prompts throughout that call, and it was really helpful.
        </p>

          I like the team. I don't want to get complacent. I don't want to ever
          feel like 'I've arrived', as David Goggins would say. He believes most
          of us work at 40%. I thought about that during my day. I tried to make
          as many calls as possible. I need the practice.
        </p>

          I've only walked about 5k steps so far today. I hope to get this post
          up and complete the rest before midnight. I also started YouTube again
          since I have a job now since that was the deal I made with myself. I
          watched a David Goggins video, and a video for work, and that's it, I
          believe.
        </p>

          I feel different as a person because of the job. It's interesting.
          Having a job brings a new perspective into my life. I wonder if most
          people just suck it up most of the time at their jobs because they
          feel like they have no choice. I feel a bit of that, but I like it. I
          want to fight. I want to thrive. I want to surprise myself.
