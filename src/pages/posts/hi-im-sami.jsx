          I was struggling to figure out what my first blog post should be
          about. I was seriously considering writing a post called 'My Abuse
          Story'. I wrote a draft and talked to a fellow victim as well. It put
          me in a weird funk and I started indulging in those childhood
          memories. I rarely think about that time and I haven't fully
          considered the impact it has had on my life. I'll just say that it was
          physical abuse and I don't believe that I'm too affected by it now.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I want to use this blog to document my journey through life, talk
          about things that interest me and maybe find a way to help people with
          it. Let me start by telling you a bit about myself.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I was born in east London on September 11 1993. I'm the 2nd oldest of
          8 boys. When I was 12 I left London and moved to Egypt with my family.
          My dad stayed back for his business. After 4 and a half years in Egypt
          I moved to the UAE. In August 2019, I moved to Pakistan and in March
          2021 I moved back to the UAE which is where I am now.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I grew up loving football. I played a lot and I was pretty good. I
          support Manchester United and as a child I dreamed of playing for
          them. I never thought I'd be allowed to so I didn't really pursue that
          dream.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A few years ago I really got into chess and had it in my mind that I
          wanted to become a grandmaster. I was naive and didn't realize the
          amount of work and effort that would go into it. It would still be
          cool to try and become a master but I have to focus on other things
          right now, mainly getting a job.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I got my bachelor's in electronics and telecommunication in 2017. I
          had a few programming courses which got me hooked on programming. I
          would write little programs and scripts about things that intrigued
          me. It's been a long journey and I finally feel like a decent coder.
          Having said that, I still feel that all too familiar imposter syndrome
          from time to time.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          At the moment I'm looking for a job as a software developer. I've
          applied a bunch, got a few interviews and some rejections too. There
          really is a lot of value in standing out from the crowd. It's a
          competitive market. I don't believe I have the greatest mindset but
          gradually I've been working on improving that. I've tried to improve
          my lazy habits that have kept me at the bottom for so long.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I'll be 28 soon and I still haven't ever had a real job. I would put
          that down to low confidence and self esteem. I wasn't very good at
          selling myself but I've gotten better. It has taken me a long time to
          get here, longer than most people.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Until recently, I was living extremely comfortably working with my dad
          at his companies. About 6 months ago I decided I wanted more from my
          life and left Pakistan to live with my younger brothers in the UAE and
          try to make it on my own without the luxury of 2 loving parents.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          One might say I've substituted my parents with my brothers. They've
          been extremely supportive so far and I have to be careful not to get
          too comfortable assuming I haven't already.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          This blog is also a way for me to practice my writing. I can be too
          critical of myself and even reading back this post makes me feel like
          it's not good enough to share. I have to let go of trying to make
          things perfect so that I can accomplish more things.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Well thanks for reading. I hope I can continue writing. I look forward
          to what life throws my way and sharing it with you.
