        <p>
          I believe I was first introduced to David Goggins by a friend, and I
          didn't get the hype right away. I probably didn't give him a fair
          shot. But over time, I felt what others felt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goggins has gone through so many hardships in his life that included
          childhood abuse, obesity, anxiety, racism, low confidence, and other
          insecurities. It's remarkable how he has been able to turn his life
          around and run as many marathons and ultramarathons as he has, among
          other incredible achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember one time listening to him and having to pause and start
          doing pushups. I must have done more than I thought I was capable of
          doing. He has this effect on people.
        </p>
        <p>
          He's my motivation a lot of the time now. He says motivation is crap
          which makes sense because it can be fleeting. It should be replaced by
          an inner drive that can withstand obstacles. Hopefully, I'll gain more
          drive as time goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've tried to adopt his principles on my daily walks. Today I walked
          almost 12k steps, and I felt like stopping at so many points. I've
          noticed myself wanting more hardships, especially on these walks. I'll
          take an extra few steps around something instead of taking a shortcut.
          When I receive some wind, I have to tell myself not to get
          comfortable, and I start wishing for more heat. It's fascinating.
        </p>
        <p>
          I often battle with conflicting emotions. Sometimes I question if pain
          is good and if the struggle is worth it. But I trust Goggins. He says
          it's worth it. The inner voice is often telling us to choose a
          difficult path. The easy way does not bring much fulfillment. The
          question remains how much struggle is too much. David Goggins probably
          hates the idea of burnout.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been trying to find different podcasts and interviews and audio
          bits of him that I can listen to on my walks. The 2 Joe Rogan podcasts
          he did were amazing. Sometimes I feel like it's cheating to listen to
          him, so I stop. He advises just being alone with your mind and trying
          to figure out who you are. So I try to use the walks for that purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want the mentality I have on my walks to trickle over into other
          areas of my life. I still notice myself procrastinating and not trying
          hard enough when I'm at home. A strong mentality could help with job
          hunting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also trying it with the new project I'm working on. I'm
          struggling, and I have to tune out the voice that says other people
          can accomplish this goal easily. I remember Goggins saying how he
          would spend hours and hours more than another person, just to get to
          the same level of knowledge. He had to put in more hours, but that
          motivated him. He's big on turning negatives into positives.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I was thinking about today was that people can walk and run
          more than I can, but I should try to push the limits of my body more
          than they do. Perhaps running a marathon for someone could be them
          performing at 40%, but for me, it could be 90%. That is what is
          important. Testing my own limits. That is where growth comes from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goggins is someone I use for inspiration. I hope whoever reads this
          finds their inspiration or has now found a new one in Goggins. Or you
          can inspire yourselves. Matthew McConaughey said something like his
          hero is him in 10 years. That's powerful. I wish you the best on your
          journeys. We are more capable than we realize.
