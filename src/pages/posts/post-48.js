          I refreshed my inbox a lot today. I did not get a response. I guess I
          have to call it then. I'm probably not getting the job. That's okay. I
          will just have to try harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked my usual 10k steps today. I listened to more of Can't Hurt Me
          on the walk. I read more of No Rules Rules as well. The more I read
          it, the more I like it.

          I changed the color scheme of my{" "}
          <a href="https://samimsu.github.io/">portfolio website</a>. The old
          one was bugging me. I want to make a few changes to this blog as well,
          but I'm not sure how to do it yet. I want to be able to navigate to
          the previous and next posts from any post. I hope I don't put it off
          for too long. I've been thinking about it for a while. I also want to
          update <a href="https://simplechat-demo.netlify.app/">SimpleChat</a>.

        <p>Sorry for the short one.</p>
