          Can I go back to not having a job? Nope, unfortunately. I have to do
          my part for myself and my family. This job is motivating me to start
          my own thing. I want to be self-employed.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hours are 9:30 am to 7:30 pm. If I factor in the time lost
          commuting, I'm left with very little time for myself each day. I could
          always manage my time better and lessen how much time I spend
          unwinding.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not all bad. I like my colleagues. I like the fun little
          conversations we have from time to time. I don't like my low
          performance though. I'm a telesales representative, and I'm struggling
          to make sales. It's hard for me to close. Most leads say thanks for
          the information and that they'll let me know later.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've watched a few videos of people selling, and it's impressive. I
          want to be a better salesman. I've downloaded a few books on it too,
          so I hope I read them and learn something.
        </p>

          I watched a few motivational videos to pump me up about life. I
          watched a great one by Arnold Schwarzenegger and another one by Earl
          Nightingale. My friend also recommended the 'I am a champion' video.
          I'll link all of them below.

          Sticking through a job in the early days, especially with all the
          uncertainties, isn't all that easy. A lot of people have come and gone
          even during my short time there. I want to stick it out as long as I
          can. I think I'd prefer getting let go than leaving on my own.
        </p>
        <p> </p>

          I'm also just waiting on getting paid. That first paycheck will be a
          huge milestone in my life. I've never gotten paid for a job before
          that wasn't at my dad's company. I did make some money freelancing
          online, but that wasn't much at all.

          It's been a while since I've posted. It's easy for your hobbies to
          slip away once you're busy with work. It happens to people all the
          time. I don't want to let go. I want to hold on to my passions.

          I streamed at work recently. I'll link that stream here too. I also
          took a break from writing this post and streamed some chess today. I
          didn't realize there was no audio. I looked so worried while playing
          chess. I didn't realize until I watched it back.

          Overall I'm settling into work. I don't want to do this forever, but I
          have to suck it up for the short term. David Goggins has helped me
          look at 'struggle' in a different way. The struggle is good. The
          comfort zone is not.
