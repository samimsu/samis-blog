        <p>
          Years ago, I started the{" "}
          <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/">fullstackopen</a> course. The
          course is served in several languages, and it's a deep dive into
          modern web development. It's a great course that they continuously
          update. It was quite challenging the first time I tried it, and I
          didn't get very far. I hope that one day I'll complete it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that anyone who completes this course can feel very capable of
          building a complete web app from scratch. The course covers React,
          Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript. As a bonus, if you
          obtain a certain number of credits, you're guaranteed an interview.
          However, It's not clear if this is limited to just residents of
          Finland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take it from me, it's a difficult course, but it's a great one. I love
          it. I love the way it's structured. I love the way it's taught. I
          highly recommend anyone to try it or at least hold on to it and try it
          when you're more able. It's not for absolute beginners. Some of the
          concepts are tough, but anything is doable with time and dedication. I
          haven't given up on it yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's no longer about getting a good grade for me. I just want to learn
          specific topics, so now I'm just going through it casually and doing
          some practice without submitting any exercises. That's another great
          thing about it. You can just go through the course. Nothing is locked
          as far as I can tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recommend checking it out, and I wish you good luck if you decide to
          give it a go.
