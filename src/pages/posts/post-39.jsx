          I finished the Matthew McConaughey podcast on my walk today. He's a
          fascinating guy, and I like some of the values he talks about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I finished the podcast, I just walked without listening to
          anything. It's different walking without listening to anything. You're
          more "in the moment" obviously, and I like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a good time to reflect on my life and figure out what I should be
          doing, whether that's for the rest of the day or some time in the
          future.
        </p>

          Today on my walk, I was thinking about the email I had received before
          I left. I heard back from the company and received a task that I have
          to do. They mentioned in the interview that this would be the next
          step. They said that it should be completed over the weekend, so I
          started today and hope to finish it by tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been spending a lot of time on it, and I think my need for
          everything to be perfect might be slowing me down. I have to build a
          user interface with different components, and they've given us a
          reference to get an idea of what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are always little quirks and things that don't look right, and
          it takes some time to resolve those issues. I know it doesn't have to
          be perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm like Goggins in that it probably takes me longer to reach a
          particular level of progress. He just learns differently, and instead
          of making excuses, he puts in more hours than others would or need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was thinking about how I probably self-sabotage myself. By thinking
          I'm not good enough, I put in less effort than I should because I
          don't expect it to matter. This realization has helped me try and
          change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to get this job. If I fail to, it's okay, but I should at least
          try as hard as I can.
