          It's been a weird day. I've been all over the place and not very
          focused. I've mostly been waiting around, hoping to hear back from the
          company I applied to.

          I submitted the task last night, and I haven't heard anything back
          from them yet. It was a frontend task where I had to build a page with
          a bunch of different components. I didn't complete it 100%, but I feel
          like I did a decent job. I have no idea how they'll receive it.
        </p>

          I started my walk late today. I listened to some Goggins but turned it
          off pretty early on into my walk. I really just wanted to be alone
          with my thoughts and figure things out. I don't know that it helped
          much.
        </p>

          I've been thinking about these posts as well and how they're not
          really that good. I guess it's inevitable that the quality will be
          compromised if I want to post daily, but I hope I can find a way to
          improve the posts.
        </p>
        <p>I hope tomorrow will be more productive.</p>
