          During Jummah prayer today at the mosque a kid was giving out water
          bottles to people. That kind gesture made me slightly emotional. I
          thought it was so nice of him to do that. I got a bottle too and I
          hope my thank you was audible. I wanted him to know how thankful I was
          and how amazing his kind gesture was.

          I couldn't get my walk in at my regular time because I went shopping.
          That got me 3k steps. I did the rest of the 10k after dinner.

          It's surprisingly harder to do things out of routine. If I go at the
          usual time, it's easier, but a little change in routine makes it
          harder. It's fascinating how habits work. It reminds me of the books
          The Power of Habit and Atomic Habits. They were both lovely books.

          I sent an email today to the company that assigned me the coding task.
          It's been about a week since it was assigned. Part of me thinks I
          didn't do a good enough job, so they didn't respond. I hope they'll
          respond to the follow-up. If I don't get it, I guess it just means I
          have to work harder than I realized. I'm ready for it. I want to be a
          fighter. I don't want to be a victim anymore.
