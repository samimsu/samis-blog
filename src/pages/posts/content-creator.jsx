          The idea of being a content creator has always intrigued me. To create
          something that others can consume. As a kid I fantasized about being
          an actor. I loved drama class. To be fair I fantasized about being a
          lot of things. That's what's great about being a kid.

          Over the years I've started a few YouTube channels, created blogs and
          started streaming. Maybe one day I can share some of my old content.
          At the moment I have this blog and my{' '}
          <a href="https://codingforcasuals.com">coding blog</a>. I also try to
          stream from time to time on{' '}
          <a href="https://twitch.tv/samiwhoosh">Twitch</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment I'm just chatting on my streams talking about various
          things like what I'm up to, books I'm reading, what I'm watching etc.
          Eventually I want to play games on stream but I've decided to wait
          until I get a job so that I don't get too distracted or lost in it. I
          would probably need to invest in some equipment to have a decent
          quality stream.

          It would be great for an introvert like me to do content creation full
          time. I believe in the possibility. I've built some confidence over
          the few streams I've done and I've enjoyed interacting with others. I
          used to be too self conscious and imagine people wouldn't like me.
          I've come to realize that most people are wonderful.
