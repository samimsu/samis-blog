          I wanted to write a more thought-out post, but I didn't prepare
          anything. I was thinking about talking about consumers and producers
          and their relationship with personal fulfillment or something. I
          didn't think too deeply about it, but I suppose I could share a little
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it's good to be a consumer sometimes, for entertainment or to
          learn the craft. You could watch movies to learn how to act or just to
          enjoy them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I think true fulfillment comes from being a producer yourself -
          being the content creator. It doesn't have to be content creation the
          way we understand it. It could just be some meaningful work. Producing
          value is what it's about.

          I've mentioned the Ted Talk with Joseph Gordon-Levitt before, in which
          he talks about getting attention versus paying attention. He talks
          about how paying attention to his craft allows him to do good work and
          brings him more joy.

          Today on my walk, I was listening to Matthew McConaughey on Joe
          Rogan's podcast. It's nice seeing a side of him we don't normally get
          to see. He's been journaling for decades and has some valuable
          insights. There's a bunch of life lessons in his story.
        </p>

          Today hasn't been a great day. I haven't been feeling too good. That's
          life. I thought I'd get an email today from the company I interviewed
          for. If I don't get one tomorrow, I suppose it means I didn't get the
          job. I'll still try to follow up though.
