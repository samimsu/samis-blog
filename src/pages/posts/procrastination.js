          by Tim Urban explains how I feel so well. He has a few blog posts
          about it as well, which goes into more depth. I love how well he
          captures it, and I relate to it so much.

          Today I was supposed to be more productive. I told myself I wasn't
          allowed to watch any more Euphoria or any other TV shows or movies,
          but of course, my brain found a loophole.

          I went on Twitch and watched a few random streamers, and I became
          engrossed by a gaming event stream where two teams were battling each
          other in Counter Strike. I'm not much of a gamer let alone someone who
          watches others play games. If I would watch others play a game, then
          it's usually only chess.

          Tim Urban explains that without deadlines procrastination can linger
          on for a long time which in turn brings long-term unhappiness and
          regrets. That is so true. At least with a college paper, there is a
          deadline, and eventually, I would turn something in even if I needed
          extensions. My friend would be surprised at how seemingly nonchalant I
          was about college work. I guess my panic monster kicked in a lot later
          than most people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In real life, there aren't really many deadlines. There's no deadline
          on getting a job, so I've never really had one. Sometimes I think I
          need to be out on the streets before I'm able to make a change.
        </p>

          I can't even finish projects that I start. Once I face a hurdle, I
          pause, but in reality, I'm quitting. I imagine I have all the time in
          the world, but I end up not using any of it. If I stay on this track,
          then I'm probably doomed. Sure I've adopted a few good habits, but
          it's just not enough.
