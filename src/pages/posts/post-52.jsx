          I've been out of it today. I almost forgot about this post. It's
          nearly 11 pm. I finished No Rules Rules last night. It's a great book
          on how Netflix is run and is a useful guideline for other
          organizations to follow. Netflix is managed so differently, from most
          companies, it's fascinating. It also sounds more appealing. They focus
          on freedom and responsibility, and it seems risky to give employees
          too much freedom, but Netflix believes the positives outweigh the
          negatives.

          I did my walk and listened to my audiobook today. I need to step up my
          game - my life game, that is. I've been slipping.
