        <p>
          It's easier to give advice than to take it so I'm going to give you
          some. I'll be 28 tomorrow. I have made many mistakes in my life. I'm
          wary about telling you to avoid something because good things can come
          from bad situations. How many people have made a great life for
          themselves precisely because they were at the bottom and struggling?
          There is something to be said about the power of rock bottom. Daymond
          John has a book about the power of broke which explains why the power
          of not having money can be an advantage rather than a disadvantage
          when trying to build a startup. It can be a motivating factor. With
          that being said, I'll try to give you food for thought rather than an
          "ALWAYS DO THIS" list and a "NEVER DO THIS" list.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have 7 brothers, 6 of them younger and it's interesting growing up
          around different personalities and to see who's doing the right things
          and who isn't. It's easier to look at younger people and make a
          judgment on their actions. Of course, adults aren't always right but
          they do pick up a few things from a life of experience. At least they
          can say what they did wrong and help younger people avoid making the
          same mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>So that's what I will try to do.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            1. Try to get along with everybody, especially your family.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You spend your early life with your family so it's a good idea to get
          along with them. Of course, that's easier said than done. I say it
          because I wish I was on better terms with my family. I wish we could
          communicate better. Often we try to blame the other person for the
          communication problems but there's something powerful about taking
          responsibility for it. I became overly quiet to avoid getting into
          arguments. All that did was make me silently resentful for all the
          ways that I thought I was being wronged. If you think someone has
          wronged you try to find a way to talk to them about it. Try to see the
          good in others. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Avoid suspicion.
          Interact with all kinds of people, especially those different from
          you. Life is richer with different perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Try to delay gratification.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Try not to indulge too much in entertainment or social media. I'm
          inclined to agree with Jaron Lanier about deleting social media
          accounts. If you can't do that then consider reducing usage. They
          often make us miserable. We use it hoping to achieve some joy and
          while sometimes we do, often we are left feeling worse afterward.
          Instant gratification comes at the cost of future fulfillment. Find a
          healthy balance. It's nice to reward yourself after you complete
          important tasks. Putting off your tasks until after you indulge in
          short-term pleasure usually doesn't work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Try not to be too dependent.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, be independent. Think for yourself. Make your own
          choices. Don't worry if they're wrong. That's how you learn. I can
          tell you from experience that living a sheltered life and having all
          my decisions made for me was not a recipe for long-term success. It
          just makes it harder when you eventually have to make your own
          decisions. You struggle to make it on your own even if you want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Try to leave the house as much as possible.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to be self-conscious about doing that and still am to some
          extent. Initially, it was because I wanted to avoid being asked
          questions by my parents about where I'm going and what I'm going to be
          doing. I felt that they didn't like me leaving the house so I
          eventually stopped doing that. I became comfortable being home all day
          that when I did go out occasionally it was hard to socialize.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5. Try to gain as much work experience as possible.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Do work for the sake of work and not money. Again that's not always
          easy to do. Work experience is far more valuable than just learning
          theory. Applying theory is more important. The sooner you start
          working the easier it is to achieve greater things. My anxiety and low
          confidence kept me from getting work experience sooner. Don't think
          about getting your dream job right away. Do any job especially when
          you're first starting out.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6. Try to do housework.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Clean, cook, do laundry, run errands, and do whatever else you can.
          This will help you when you eventually move out. Being the older kid
          allowed me to get away with not doing housework because my younger
          brothers would do it. In a house with 8 boys, it's easy to get away
          with not helping out when there are so many helping hands. Being
          stubborn didn't help my cause either. It's good to be kind and
          generous. It not only helps the other person but it makes you feel
          good and useful too.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>7. Try to read more.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Read as much as you can. Do not worry about retaining everything. You
          can always reread books. The point is to open your mind and be exposed
          to the unique perspectives of different people. It will also help you
          better articulate your thoughts which in turn will help you make
          better life decisions. I like self-improvement books but you can learn
          a lot from fiction too.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>8. Try to chase your dreams.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this is a great idea. Don't always try to be rational. Be
          bold. Be crazy. If we're not doing what we love then what is the
          point? Failing is okay as long as you give it a shot. If it was easy
          we'd all be doing it. Most of us settle. You don't have to.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is by no means an exhaustive list. These are just some important
          things that I found relevant for my own life. I hope you take
          something away from it.
