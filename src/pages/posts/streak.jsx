          It's 11:18 pm when I'm starting this post. I almost forgot to post and
          would have lost my daily streak. This post should be up before
          midnight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wonder if I should hold on to a streak just for the sake of it. Am I
          sacrificing quality for quantity? I've read that doing something every
          day makes you better at it. So while I could wait until I have a
          really good post to share, perhaps the practice will help me
          eventually have better posts.

          I know that holding on to perfectionism can be harmful. It has hurt me
          in the past. I guess that is why I used to procrastinate and still do
          sometimes. Wanting something to be perfect can prevent me from even
          attempting the thing in the first place.
        </p>

          Then again, there can be some harm. I suppose there's a balance as
          with all things. I know that daily vloggers have spoken about the
          strain daily vlogging had on their relationships.

          Another streak I'm on is walking. I try to walk daily. Today I had to
          help someone out with technical issues and stuff, so I was pretty
          drained. I managed about 4,000 steps today, but I had run over 10,000
          steps for three consecutive days before that. I didn't realize it had
          been three days.

          I like the routine of it. I like getting away from my devices.
          Sometimes I fantasize about giving up my phone entirely.
        </p>

          All I need in my life right now is a way to be self-sufficient. My
          family wonders about me. I wonder about me. I wanted a job within the
          first week I got here, but it's been over six months.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope that being out in the world will give me some perspective and
          push me harder on the job hunt.
