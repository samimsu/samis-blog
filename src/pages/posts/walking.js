          I might be becoming a walker. I've been trying to go on daily walks an
          hour or two before sunset. I've been at it for a few days now. I
          missed a day because I went to play table tennis with my brother,
          which was fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point of the walks is mainly to get out of the house and
          experience the world around me. There is the added benefit of getting
          some activity/exercise in. Recently someone told me I should get out
          more. I agreed. It's no good staying cooped up in my room all day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been enjoying the walks. I see kids cycling around, people
          playing sports, and others just going about their day. I often sit on
          the ledge by the mall and observe the people walking by. I wonder
          about what's going on in their lives. I look at the loud highway
          traffic and wonder about those people too. I want to take it all in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never used to be a fan of walking. My friend would want me to go on
          walks, but I would prefer staying in my room and doing something else
          like watch YouTube together. When I would go on walks with him, they
          weren't too bad. We would get a chance to talk, but other than that, I
          wouldn't see much benefit in it. I believe it was doing me some good
          without me even knowing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking alone would give me terrible anxiety. It's a lot better now,
          and with each walk, I think it's getting easier. I would be
          self-conscious if I had to walk alone. I would wonder what the people
          around me were thinking of me. I'd worry that I may do something silly
          like trip over or worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          To combat that, I started walking with headphones and listening to
          David Goggins. He's an inspiration, and I hope I can eventually do
          something like he has. Some day I want to run a marathon. My current
          walks are only about 2,000 steps, and I'm amazed that people do 10,000
          daily. That will be my first milestone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today I walked over 4,500 steps. I walked around the entire mall,
          which isn't a lot, but it was a decent amount. For the first time, I
          walked without headphones. I wanted to be alone with my mind and try
          to understand myself. No grand discoveries yet, but I hope the more I
          do it, the more clarity I'll receive. For now, it's just about getting
          over the anxiety, and to try and do it daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were a few other reasons for me not to walk apart from the
          anxiety. The hot weather was a big one. The UAE is known for it, but I
          found a good time to walk when I'd have a lot of shade, and it
          wouldn't be as hot. Before sunset has worked out well for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason was not having anywhere to walk. Most of the area
          around me is just sand, but now I see that as a good thing. I like the
          struggle of walking through sand, and eventually, I get to regular
          ground when I get close to the mall.
        </p>
        <p>
          David Goggins has helped me see struggles differently. He thrives in
          terrible conditions. He likes doing things that people wouldn't
          normally like running in the rain/snow. I like that and want to adopt
          that mentality. I want to do stuff that most people wouldn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was extra busy today because of the weekend. There were families
          around, and I was happy to see them. It made me think about my
          potential future family. I used to think I didn't like people much,
          but the more I see them and think about their struggles, the more I
          wish them the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking is a stepping stone for higher ambitions. I hope I continue to
          do it as often as possible. Eventually, I want to start running. And
          then, maybe I can run a marathon. It's nice to have something to work
          towards.
