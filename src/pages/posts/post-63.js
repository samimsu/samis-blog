          I removed the link to this blog from my LinkedIn profile. I thought I
          wanted to share as much as possible about myself with the world, but
          I'm not sure if that's the case anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked at my last post which was back in November, and I didn't like
          watching that Twitch clip back. I'm not sure what it was. Perhaps
          there's a bit of cringe there.
        </p>

          I'm in the second month of my three-month internship with Letswork. I
          left my old company because there was a lot of uncertainty there, and
          I wanted to find something better. I found a Web Developer internship
          that is more aligned with my interests. I wanted a job in tech, and I
          sorta have one now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel myself evolving. I don't know if it's entirely a good thing. I
          was pretty new to the workforce back then, and now I guess I'm just
          another cog in the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't want to be just like everyone else, though. I don't want to
          hate work. I don't want to lose my creativity. I don't want to lose my
          ambition. I don't want to lose my soul. But perhaps that is what
          happens to everyone eventually. Why should I be any different?
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish I could be excited about every day. I wish I could be excited
          about work. I'm sure a lot of it is my mindset, and I can choose
          happiness, as Shay Carl would say.
