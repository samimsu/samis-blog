        <p>
          Today I've been feeling a little under the weather. It took some
          mental energy to get back out of bed when I tried to lay down before
          going for a walk. I managed 10,000+ steps again. The hope was it would
          help fight my illness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried the same mental approach to get up and write this post. I was
          half thinking I was going to skip the walk and the blog post today.
          The mind is pretty powerful. I forget that. I know I've used the power
          of my mind throughout my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess this blog has sort of become a journal. What's the difference?
          According to Wikipedia:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            A blog (a truncation of "weblog")<sup>[1]</sup> is a discussion or
            informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of
            discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are
            typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most
            recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          So I guess it can be a journal. Hopefully, it'll become more
          informative as time goes on. I'm not sure what kind of insights I
          could have that would help others, but everyone has something of value
          to share, right? I'd like to think so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose just documenting my journey through life can sort of be a
          roadmap. Maybe there could be lessons about what to do and what not to
          do. Maybe people can read this and pick apart what's going right or
          wrong with me? I feel like an outsider's perspective can be pretty
          valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the walk, I started feeling more ill but getting up just now for
          the post has helped lessen it. I often hear that you shouldn't wrap
          yourself up if you have a fever. I'm not sure if that helps, but it
          seems to be working right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll have dinner soon, so that should keep my energy up. I was going
          to say I hope I feel better tomorrow, but maybe this is exactly the
          kind of struggle I should welcome, as Goggins would say. Struggle is
          good. There are lessons to be learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to become more mindful and self-aware. I want to
          understand myself and the world around me and use it to accomplish
          goals. Understanding others is a valuable skill for success. For
          example, knowing your customers and what they like is clearly a good
          idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, I hope I can fight through this little patch, sort out my
          priorities and put my life on an upward trajectory.
