          I've spent a lot of hours over the weekend working on the front-end
          task given to me by the company I'm interviewing with. It's been fun
          and challenging. I just want to do a good job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to get a quick post up, return to the task, and get as much
          done as possible. There are always little things to improve and
          features to add. I've sent them a link to the demo. I hope it's okay
          so far.

          I listened to more of the David Goggins audiobook on my walk today. I
          rushed my walk to come back and watch a football game, then completed
          10,000 steps after the game.
        </p>

          I've been trying to embrace discomfort and acknowledge its benefits.
          Being uncomfortable is good, and that's where growth comes from.
          Anything meaningful requires effort.
