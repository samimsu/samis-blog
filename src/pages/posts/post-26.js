          I couldn't think of a topic to write about. I thought I was going to
          miss today and be relieved because I wouldn't have to keep the streak
          anymore.
        </p>

          There's value in sticking to something, especially on the days when
          you don't feel like it. I went to pick up my brother from work and
          just got back a little while ago, so I have time to write.

          I'm not a big fan of driving. I don't think I have the best spatial
          awareness in a car. I'm short, so it doesn't help when I'm crouched in
          my seat. In this car, I haven't been able to find the perfect seat
          setting, but it's manageable. I've been trying to manage the anxiety
          of driving, and I believe it's better now. Then again, I don't drive
          that much, so I'm not getting the regular practice that will help me
          get more comfortable.

          Today has been a slow day. I've been experimenting with{" "}
          <a href="https://simplechat-demo.netlify.app/">SimpleChat</a> and
          trying to add features but adding one seemed to mess up the UI, so I
          decided to refactor the code a bit to make it easier to add features
          in the future.

          I like doing handy stuff around the house. I fixed the keylock of our
          door last night, and today I fixed a cupboard door in the kitchen. I
          also took down the broken kitchen cabinet by unscrewing and pulling
          hard because it was also nailed into the wall. There was something
          quite satisfying about doing all those things.

          I watched a bit of Twitch too today. The{" "}
          <a href="https://championschesstour.com/">
            Meltwater Champions Chess Tour Finals 2021
          </a>{" "}
          were being streamed, and I like watching Magnus Carlsen play. He'll be
          in this country soon for the World Championship, which will be super
          exciting. I hope I get to see him.
        </p>

          I haven't decided which books to read this month. I should probably
          sort that out soon and figure out a new project to build after I
          polish up SimpleChat with a few features.
