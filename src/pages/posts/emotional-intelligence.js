          I've been reading a book called "Emotional Intelligence" by Daniel
          Goleman. I've probably been reading it for a few months now. It seems
          long but I'm also a pretty slow reader. Procrastination doesn't help
          nor does reading multiple books at once.

          The book argues emotional intelligence is a much better predictor of
          future success than IQ and I'm inclined to agree. I might be
          considered as someone with a reasonable level of IQ but that hasn't
          helped me on the job front. I have seen time and time again that those
          people who are better socially are the ones who acquire the most
          success. It makes complete sense to me. Being able to navigate your
          emotions and use them effectively can go a long way.

          It's been a great read so far. It cites several experiments that have
          been done on various kinds of people from children to couples. It
          offers an explanation on many issues including divorce, bullying, and
          health problems. It shows how the way we feel has a significant impact
          on our quality of life.

          I'm reading hoping I can control my negative emotions and develop a
          more optimistic outlook on life. I have tried to be more aware of my
          emotions and try to combat the negative ones.
