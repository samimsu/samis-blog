          I didn't have the best walk today. I got my 10k steps, but I really
          had to drag myself. I was taking little steps and walking slowly. I
          just wasn't really feeling it. I guess those are the days when you
          have to do it most.

          I added <a href="https://simplechat-demo.netlify.app/">SimpleChat</a>{' '}
          to my <a href="https://samimsu.github.io/">portfolio website</a>, so
          I'm happy about that. There are a few things I could add to
          SimpleChat. I'll see if I do. I added a loading icon for when the
          messages are loading, which I really like.

          I started No Rules Rules, which is a book co-authored by the Netflix
          CEO. It's been a good read so far. I haven't gotten too far, but it
          seems pretty intriguing.

          There isn't much progress on the job front to report. I sent an email
          out today to someone I found on LinkedIn who was hiring.

          I know I need to network more, but social media irks me, including
          LinkedIn. I'm sure there's a way to use it where I would feel less
          weird about it.
