          Yesterday I had told myself that I should try and do 20,000 steps
          today. I wasn't sure I could do it. 10,000 steps became less
          difficult, and I wanted to challenge myself. It was also a sort of
          punishment for being lazier than usual the past couple of days. I
          wanted to reach the point where I felt like quitting and keep going. I
          wanted to test my mental hardness and see if I could push through.
          There were some wins and some losses during this walk. Listening to
          David Goggins during the walk helped.

          The first part seemed too easy. I thought I was going to breeze
          through. I wasn't monitoring my step count during the first part. I
          was going to check when I reached Zahia City Center. When I got close,
          I figured I had done way over 10k steps. I felt a little defeated when
          I saw that it was barely over 9k. A part of me liked that because it
          meant I had to struggle even more. By the time I walked to the prayer
          room in the mall, prayed, and left the mall, I had reached 10k. Here's
          the route for the first part. It starts from Safari Mall, but there
          were a few hundred steps before that from my place to the mall.

        <p>
          I took a shorter route on the way back because I had to pick up a few
          things from Safari Mall, so I thought I'd be able to reach the second
          10k by the time I got home. I had barely gotten 15k when I reached the
          mall, so I did the shopping I needed to then took a round of the mall
          with two shopping bags in hand and went home because it was time for
          dinner. I knew I wasn't going to make 20k by the time I got home, but
          I used dinner as an excuse to cut it short. I had every intention of
          finishing up later though. By the time I got home, I was at around
          17k. Here's the route for the second part.

        <p>
          After dinner, I didn't have any motivation to do the 3k, but I knew I
          had to. I was comfortable in bed, but the day was not over. I knew
          once I got out of the house, I'd get it done. Once again, I needed my
          pal David Goggins to push me through, and he did. I prayed the final
          prayer of the day and left. I ended up managing 20,304 steps in total.
          The route for this part was just a walk around my area.

          It would be nice to one day walk 20k steps without taking any breaks.
          I'll have to find a block of time where I have a few hours when I
          can't be interrupted. The morning time seems like the best. I'll have
          to plan for that. It wasn't easy doing 20k steps, so I'm not sure how
          soon I want to put myself through that again. I had to leave earlier,
          and it took a lot longer than I expected.
        </p>

          This milestone is a nice win for me. I went from laying in bed all day
          to becoming a daily 10k steps walker to today, where I did 20k steps
          in a single day. I don't know that I've ever done that in my life. It
          makes me wonder what else I'm capable of. I want to continue testing
          my limits.
