          I walked 10,000 steps today, according to my phone. That was my first
          time. How do people do that regularly? It didn't feel easy at all. I
          can't imagine doing that daily, but maybe I should, and it will get
          easier. I did seven rounds of the mall and then went home, but I still
          was a few hundred steps away from 10k, so I walked around my area a
          bit more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't listen to anything on my walk today. I tried to pay attention
          to my thoughts, but it was mostly a jumble. I guess near the end, I
          was trying to push myself and think of reasons why I was doing this
          walk in the first place. I started this whole thing to get out of the
          house and get some clarity. I guess there are health benefits, and I
          think it can help with social anxiety. I imagine it helps with stress
          relief too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't quite know much of the benefits of walking. Initially, I
          started walking in slippers and jeans. Eventually, I think I'll have
          to get better gear. The slippers bruised my foot, so now I've switched
          to shoes. It's a lot more comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel a little out of shape, but I enjoy the mental strength I need
          to use to overcome it. I felt some backache, so I tried to combat it
          by straightening it as much as I could, and I paid attention to the
          slight changes in feeling. Eventually, the little ache went away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole process is quite fascinating. It rotates between easy and
          hard. At first, it's easy, then hard, then easy, then hard, and so on.
          I wonder how long this cycle can go on for. People often talk about
          second winds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope I don't tire myself out and get sick of walking. I have to find
          a way to make it more satisfying like James Clear says in his book
          about making habits stick. The whole challenge aspect of it is lovely.
          I want to push myself and use that to perhaps challenge myself in
          other areas of my life.
