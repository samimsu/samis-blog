          Today I had two online interviews. I felt like they went well. They
          weren't really for junior positions, but I tried to make it clear that
          my level was junior-ish.
        </p>
        <p>
          One company is local and seems promising. I feel like I could be a
          good fit, but perhaps I don't have all the required experience though
          I feel like I have enough. I should hear back within a week if I'm
          shortlisted. The next stage would be more technical, which sounds
          exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other interview was with an American startup which also sounds
          exciting. The interview was longer, and I got to really show myself in
          it. I talked about my professional experience as well as some personal
          anecdotes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoyed the heavy tech discussion where I learned about the
          company's stack and talked about my experiences with it and what I was
          good at and what I wasn't. I feel like I gave them a clear sense of my
          expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also managed 12,000+ steps in total today. The weather was nice.
          Very cloudy and cool. I'm barely breaking a sweat nowadays. It might
          be the weather or my body getting used to these walks or both. I
          listened to some Goggins. I'm listening to stuff I've already listened
          to. I hope the repetition drills it into my brain. I was having issues
          with my earphones, so I eventually just turned it off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy to have experienced today. I'm not sure if the two companies
          will get in touch with me, but I'm still glad I got some more
          interview experience. It's good practice and it allows me to build my
          confidence and get better at selling myself.
