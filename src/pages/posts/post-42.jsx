        <p>
          I always put off writing these posts until the end of the day. I don't
          know if that's the best idea. I suppose I want to write about my day,
          so it makes sense to wait. That wasn't the plan initially when I
          started this blog. I didn't want it to be a log of things I do
          throughout my day per se.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll have to revisit my 'why'. Why am I doing this? What is this for?
          I know that I want to connect with people. I want to provide value. I
          want people to enjoy reading my content. Perhaps I can impart some
          wisdom or just some knowledge. I'm not sure. Like I said, I'll have to
          think about what I'm doing it all for.
        </p>
        <p>
          A streak is a terrible reason. It's good to be consistent, but
          providing value should be the top priority. I guess stumbling upon
          MrBeast's Twitter triggered this introspection. He's a great content
          creator. Since I haven't been on YouTube, I haven't seen his newer
          stuff. Beyond being a great content creator, he seems like a great
          guy. I like him. I like his Twitter bio.

          I feel the same way. I imagine most people do, but perhaps we don't
          think about it as often as we should. We get caught up in the
          day-to-day minutia of life. We want our lives to be meaningful but
          aren't quite sure how to get there. Perhaps it comes from providing
          value to others. Then again, it could be about fulfilling your
          potential. About being the best version of you that you can be.
        </p>

          Now I'm wondering about the lives I've touched negatively. Are there
          people in this world that hate me? I've certainly made mistakes and
          continue to. I've said some mean things. I've been cruel. Can I offset
          the negative with a lot of positives? How does one live with
          themselves knowing how much harm they've caused? Some things still
          haunt me.

          Etika couldn't live with himself. His final video is powerful. Perhaps
          he didn't feel like he deserved to go on because of his sins. I just
          watched the video again. It's quite the video. It puts things into
          perspective. He did a lot of apologizing in it. He stresses the
          dangers of social media and that your words hold weight. I guess he
          was a troll and let things get out of hand. I'm not too familiar with
          what his content was and the controversies surrounding him. In the
          video, he seems like a nice guy, and he wants people to take something
          away from his life.
        </p>

          I like thinking about these things. I've been lost in my devices for a
          lot of my life, and I want to escape them. I don't want to be on
          social media, but sometimes I can't help it. I fantasize about one day
          not having a phone or having a really basic phone just for calling.
          It's hard to break free. I've turned off a lot of notifications on my
          phone. I think it has helped quite a bit. I've also deleted a lot of
          apps. I still go on through the websites but adding that extra layer
          makes sure I go on less. I deleted my Facebook account. It's hard to
          measure the benefits, but I believe it's there somewhere. Maybe I need
          to wait a bit more to see the benefits it will bring to my life. The
          goal now is to stay away and not get sucked back in.

          I haven't been reading the past couple of days. I was reading No Rules
          Rules, which is a book about Netflix. I listened to Can't Hurt Me on
          my walk today. I like walking. It's been a few weeks now, I reckon.
          It's good to get out of the house. I don't see a lot of tangible
          results, but I'm sure they're there. I just have to keep going. I've
          lived the alternative life for far too long. It feels pretty bad. I'm
          also holding out hope for that job opportunity. It's about time that
          things turned around.
