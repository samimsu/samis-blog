        <p>
          I wanted to write about some regrets I've had over the years. Maybe
          people can use it as a cautionary tale and see what to avoid. Here's a
          list with a small description of some of my regrets:
        </p>
        <h3>Not pursuing my dream to become a football player</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to become a football player as a kid, but I was afraid my
          parents would say no, so I never really told them. I may have
          mentioned it casually to my mom, but I didn't push it. I was mainly
          worried that my dad would say no.
        </p>
        <h3>Not speaking up when I was physically abused </h3>
        <p>
          Between the ages of 8 and 12 roughly, I was studying to memorize the
          Quran, and my teacher would hit me. I was made to think it was fine
          and normal but I don't believe it should be.
        </p>
        <h3>Being a bully to my brothers</h3>
        <p>
          I don't know where my anger came from, but I was angry most of the
          time, and I took it out on my brothers. I don't know if it came from
          being abused, but I was still a bully for a while after the abuse had
          stopped.
        </p>
        <h3>Ghosting everyone when I left Egypt</h3>
        <p>
          I stopped talking to almost everybody from Egypt for about three
          months after I left. Maybe it was a way to seek attention. It was
          wrong and selfish, and now I don't have those friendships anymore.
        </p>
        <h3>Failing school</h3>
        <p>
          I was good at school as a kid, but I stopped caring in my later years.
          I took 3 subjects for AS and failed all 3. I didn't try. I didn't
          care. That (as well as other things) set me back a few years, and I
          got my bachelor's degree pretty late.
        </p>
        <h3>Being too quiet</h3>
        <p>
          This has probably kept me from achieving a lot more things. I was too
          anxious and afraid to talk to people. I would avoid conversation as
          much as possible and sometimes hide so I wouldn't have to face people.
        </p>
        <h3>Not trying to work at Gitex</h3>
        <p>
          Gitex is a local biannual electronics exhibition that a lot of
          students work at. I had too much anxiety and reservation at the time
          to do it. I imagine a part of me didn't know how to talk to parents
          about it. I wasn't very good at communicating with them. I probably
          avoided a bunch of things for fear of being told no.
        </p>
        <h3>Not hanging out with friends more</h3>
        <p>
          I wish I got out more and met my friends. Part of the hesitance was
          living with my parents and dealing with their questions. Now that I
          live without them, I don't have those close friends living near me
          anymore.
        </p>
        <h3>Not trying harder to look for a job when I graduated</h3>
        <p>
          I was pretty lazy. I procrastinated a lot. I was addicted to YouTube
          and Discord. I would spend all day on those things without looking for
          a job. I would also go to my dad's office and do some work, but I was
          never happy about that. I suppose I was pretty distracted and
          confused.
        </p>
        <h3>Not communicating better with my family and friends</h3>
        <p>
          I wish I were better at talking to people about how I felt. I wasn't
          assertive, and I would go along with whatever people wanted to do. I
          didn't think for myself.
        </p>
        <h3>Not planning for my future</h3>
        <p>
          I never cared to think about my future. I was too confused. I didn't
          like the idea of doing it. A rough plan would have been okay. I never
          thought about university or work. I just let life happen for the most
          part without taking action.
        </p>
        <p>
          So those are a few regrets I've had over these past 28 years. I hope
          people can take something away from it and hopefully avoid making the
          same mistakes.
