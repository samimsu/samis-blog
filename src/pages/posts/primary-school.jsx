          I moved about quite a bit in my life, so I attended a few different
          schools. I vaguely recall joining a playgroup before nursery, but I
          don't remember much about that time apart from perhaps eating a
          biscuit I was offered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I joined Selwyn Primary School, which was my favorite school I've
          ever been to in my life. At the time, there was no mandatory uniform,
          but now there is. I love how free it felt to be there. We could
          express ourselves and do a lot. It was a caring and nurturing
          environment. The teachers were great from nursery to year six.
        </p>

          I have so many fond memories from the friends to the trips. There was
          a giant hill in the nursery which the kids would roll down. That was a
          lot of fun. I remember feeling appreciated throughout my school years
          for the work I would do. It's such a great atmosphere to be in where
          you're rewarded and appreciated for your work. All those gold stars
          and stickers do wonders for a child's development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I enjoyed all my subjects. I enjoyed painting, reading,
          writing, math, and the lot. I liked seeing our work displayed on the
          walls. It made us feel proud of our work. We would read Harry Potter
          in class, and like most British kids at the time, we loved the series.
          The first book came out while I was in Primary School. I think for one
          of our trips we went to see one of the films.

          I got exposed to football in my early years. It seemed like everyone
          would want to play. It felt crowded, and all I wanted was to get a
          touch. Over the years, my obsession allowed me to get better and
          better. I would play in the garden at home too. I was considered one
          of the best in the school. I loved playing during our breaks.
          Sometimes we'd play with a tennis ball which was still fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember doing some training with a coach from Tottenham I believe
          it was. There were a bunch of us, and it was fun. I remember being
          quite nervous because I didn't want to perform poorly in front of the
          coach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember playing football during summer school too. I don't quite
          remember what summer school was for. I think it was optional, and I
          loved it. It was one of the best times. It was fun. I believe it was
          during that time that someone saw me play football and suggested I
          join a football club or something. That was quite the boost.
        </p>

          A handful of students and I skipped year five and went to year six. We
          were supposedly gifted and talented. They had a whole separate program
          for us. We went on a lot of trips that year which was fun. I can't
          remember all of them, but I imagine there were a few museums that we
          went to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think because of our ages, we couldn't go to year seven, so we did
          year six twice, which wasn't bad. I probably missed the old class, and
          we got to be reunited again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got along with most people, and I loved hanging out with everyone.
          It was a time of wonder, fun, silly crushes, and growth. If only I
          could relive it again.
