          I happened to wake up earlier today only to fall back asleep after
          breakfast. My life is pretty routine. I have my daily walks, which are
          nice. I'm always trying to spot Teslas on my walk. I think it's about
          more than just the car. It's about my admiration for Elon. I love the
          way Elon thinks. I find his interviews captivating. He shares these
          nuggets of wisdom that I'm often impressed by. I love his history. I
          love his story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since I discovered him, I've been in awe of him. I did a paper on
          hyperloop in 2014 I believe, and that's how I found out about him.
          From that point on, I was hooked. I remember messaging Tesla about
          when the UAE would have Teslas, and I got a callback. That was years
          ago while I was still in university. I was so surprised to get that
          call.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be a dream to be able to work at Tesla. I don't think I'm
          qualified enough, but maybe one day I will be. A lot of people share
          my admiration for Elon. He's very relatable, and he has a great story.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wonder about my story. I wonder if there's a way to make it better.
          I want to surprise myself and accomplish things that seem impossible
          right now. I don't want to be mediocre. I have a lot to learn. I want
          to take that journey. I've been trying to improve, but I know I'm not
          giving it everything. I need to cut down on even more distractions. It
          could get lonely, but perhaps that's the only way.
