        <p>
          I may be running out of topics to talk about. Can I just talk about a
          bunch of random things in a single post? Perhaps. But then I'd
          probably have to figure out what to title the posts. Maybe the date
          will suffice. Or a comma-separated list of topics discussed in the
          post. As you can tell, this is quite the work in progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other thing is I have to have unique titles because I'm storing
          each post as a separate file and using the same file name and title
          name. I don't have to use the same name, but I haven't thought of an
          alternative method yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, let's get to the topic mentioned in the title, Manchester
          United. Ever since I was a kid back in England, I've supported
          Manchester United. My older brother was the first one to support them,
          so I sort of just followed along. I trusted his judgment. He was
          really passionate. I wanted to support the best team.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a good time to support them. We had arguably the greatest
          manager of all time leading us, and the accolades that we collected
          along the way were just impressive. Manchester United was extremely
          dominant and consistent for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had incredible players with the greatest being Cristiano Ronaldo.
          The first time I saw him play, I was mesmerized. I wanted to be like
          him. In fact, I wanted to be better. At some point, I had the delusion
          that I could be. I was pretty young. I wanted to be a footballer, but
          that didn't work out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all good things must come to an end, and so did our dominance with
          the retirement of our manager Sir Alex Ferguson. He managed United for
          about 26 years, and we've had a few managers since he left in 2013.
          It's really a testament to his leadership to see the stark contrast of
          the team without him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think like most fans, I want to relive the glory days, but perhaps
          we'll never reach a period as successful as the one under Ferguson's
          reign. I've come to grips with that fact, and I don't get too
          emotional when things don't work out as others might. I try to keep my
          composure, but I do share the frustration that many fans do from time
          to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a positive note, it's great to have Cristiano Ronaldo back in our
          team. That really lifted all the fans. We can't rest all our hopes on
          him. He has given us so much already, and he may be nearing retirement
          age. I'd be happy to see him playing till 50. He's still performing at
          an incredible level, and it's amazing to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love our latest manager Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r. For the first time
          since Ferguson left, I'm completely happy with who our manager is.
          I've gotten behind each manager because they're managing United, but
          Ole is something else. He's a United fan, and he's passionate about
          the team. That's why I love him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, there's a United game in about 10 minutes, so I'll try to get
          this post up before then or may have to try during the start of the
          game if I want it up before midnight.
