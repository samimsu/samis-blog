          Happy Mental Health Day. Perhaps the word 'happy' isn't appropriate
          for that. Mental health is interesting because I feel like now more
          than ever, people have a lot of struggles with it.

          I think our devices are partly to blame. I think we don't quite
          understand the harm of social media yet. There's a ton of information
          out there about it. Social media has ironically made us less social.

          It's nice to be able to talk about it. It's nice to know you're not
          alone and that other people battle with the same issues. My main issue
          is with social anxiety, which was exacerbated during my time at
          university. It's hard to self-diagnose myself with depression, but I
          imagine I've had bouts of that throughout my life.

          I imagine the daily walks are helping with my mental health. It's nice
          to get out of the house every day for an hour or two. Before I started
          walking, I probably didn't even get that much outdoor time in a week.

          Today, I just did minor tweaks to{" "}
          <a href="https://simplechat-demo.netlify.app/">SimpleChat</a>. I also
          went on my daily walk and got my 10,000 steps. Eventually, I want to
          start running once I have the right gear. Who knows, I might enjoy
          running. That will probably begin after I get a job.

          Speaking of, I received an email a little while ago for the next
          interview stage. This interview is with the local company that I had
          my first interview with about a week ago. I'm excited and looking
          forward to it.
