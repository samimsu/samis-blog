          I wasn't always an introvert. I became extremely introverted in
          university. I would spend time in the bathroom to avoid talking to
          people. I was insanely quiet. I was awkward. I forgot how to
          communicate with people. I was lost in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dad gave me a pep talk before joining university. I was the only
          one that would get those talks and it's perhaps because I was the
          problem child. It was something about avoiding people who do
          questionable things in university. I shouldn't have taken that too
          seriously. It isolated me from everyone else. Despite my issues I was
          pretty obedient albeit reluctantly so.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friend from school joined the same university and I couldn't
          connect with him anymore. I felt alone. He had quickly settled in with
          everyone else and I hadn't. That first year wasn't easy. I wanted to
          drop out so many times but I stuck through it. In retrospect maybe
          that was the right thing to do. I'm not 100% convinced of that though.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became extremely self conscious. I was self conscious about simple
          tasks that normal people could do easily. I was afraid of looking
          silly. I had intense anxiety. I would question if I was doing a task
          the right way. I had low confidence. I couldn't think for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It got easier each year. I guess that's what it's like to settle in.
          It just took me longer than most people. I was lucky to get close with
          someone. I guess he was a bit of an outcast like me but for different
          reasons. He tried to be very social with everyone but it didn't always
          pan out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess I was one of the few who was glad to be his friend. He really
          made the effort to connect. I appreciated that. I guess that's what I
          was looking for. I couldn't just connect with people right off the
          bat. It took time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of university, I would stay in my bedroom all day. I would lay
          in bed using the laptop. I would watch youtube and TV shows and chat
          to people online. I guess that primal need for social connection was
          being satisfied through my screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became really addicted to YouTube especially. I was obsessed with
          watching vlogs. I loved seeing how other people lived. Perhaps I
          wanted their lives. My biggest vlog addictions were the Shaytards and
          BFvsGF. A lot of people shared this addiction. There was something
          magical about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I got addicted to the internet the less I wanted anything to
          do with real people. When guests would come over I'd stay in my room
          and get so anxious about having to meet them. I'd wish I could stay in
          my room the whole time until they left. When I would have to interact
          with them I felt the encounters were always awkward. I struggled to
          make proper conversation. Perhaps I didn't see the point of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's fascinating to think about now. I think I've changed a little bit
          but I still have a long way to go. I enjoy other people's company more
          now even if I still struggle to connect. I've heard that loneliness
          kills and there's a lot of truth in that. Having good meaningful
          relationships are what make a life worth living. I'm starting to see
          that now.
