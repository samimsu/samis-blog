        <p>
          I can't remember the exact date I quit YouTube, but it's probably been
          around five months now. I didn't expect to be away from it this long.
          I planned not to go on YouTube until I got a job. YouTube was probably
          my biggest addiction, and I gave it up. I thought that would motivate
          me more to find a job, so I'd find one sooner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite quitting, I haven't found a job yet. I replaced my YouTube
          addiction with other things like movies, TV shows, Twitch streams, and
          Discord. I suppose I have applied for more jobs, and quitting YouTube
          was a positive step, but it wasn't enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did, however, watch a YouTube embedded video for a coding program.
          That is the only video I watched like that. There have been other
          videos that I've found in Google search results and downloaded from a
          third-party site. I've used some loopholes, but as far as going on
          YouTube and watching videos goes, I've stayed away for the most part.
          I may have gone on accidentally or been linked and closed it almost
          right away. There have been times where I've wanted to learn
          something, and I couldn't because of my commitment. I suppose there
          have been some benefits to quitting, but I miss going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suspect I wouldn't have built my{" "}
          <a href="https://samimsu.github.io">portfolio website</a> and this
          blog if I was still on YouTube. It's hard to know for sure. I like
          taking radical steps sometimes, hoping for a change. I've made a few
          of those decisions in my life. I quit smoking out of the blue before I
          started university and haven't gone back since.
        </p>
        <p>
          I deleted my Facebook account recently too, and all social media apps
          on my phone. I still go on the websites from time to time but not
          having the apps has helped reduce usage. I haven't felt a massive
          change yet, but maybe it's hard for me to see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So to summarize, I quit YouTube to get a job, but I haven't found one
          yet. The whole process of applying has been soul-sucking. It stresses
          me out, but it's necessary. Let's hope something pans out soon.
