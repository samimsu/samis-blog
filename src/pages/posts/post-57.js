          I did not plan to walk 30,000 steps today. This achievement is another
          first for me. I left before 6 am. The sun wasn't up yet. I had
          completed 20,000 steps before 8:15 am. I didn't plan to walk 20,000
          steps, but then on the walk, I remembered that I said I'd need to find
          a block of time to do 20k steps all in one go. There was no time like
          then to achieve that goal. That's pretty much what I did with almost
          no stops. The stops would have lasted a few seconds anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt weirder than usual being out. Everyone was pretty much getting
          ready for work or school, and I was just this weirdo walking around.
          It was nice to see that there were others up early exercising when I
          got to Safari Mall.
        </p>

          It was really quiet in the beginning. I expected that, but it was
          still surprising. I liked it. I tried an extended route, and it was
          nice. It's exciting seeing a new place. I think it makes the walk
          easier to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't feel tired per se at the end. The only thing was that my
          heels were hurting, but it was manageable. I thought maybe running on
          my toes would make it easier, but I didn't try. I'm still holding off
          on running until I have a more appropriate outfit. I still wear jeans
          and a shirt for my walks. I had to walk around Safari Mall twice to
          make sure I got 20k before I got home. I used a David Goggins quote to
          help me push through near the end.
        </p>
        <p>"Don't stop when you're tired, stop when you're done."</p>
        <p>
          That's how I remember the quote, but I just saw that it's "you are"
          instead of "you're". Huge difference, I know.
        </p>

          I opened the Huawei Health app to take the screenshot for the step
          count, and I also saw this.

        <p>
          I guess I hadn't opened the app at least since October 30. I usually
          just monitor the step count from the notification. It's nice to know
          I've been consistent for that long. It doesn't seem so hard anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also went shopping in the afternoon, so I got a few thousand steps
          that way. Before sunset, I did my regular walk. I wasn't sure I would,
          but I felt able, so I did. That took my step count to over 33,000.
