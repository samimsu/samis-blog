          I listened to more of the David Goggins audiobook on my 10k steps walk
          today. I'm almost halfway through. It could be one of my books for
          this month. I haven't read No Rules Rules in a while. I need to get
          back to it if I want to finish it before the end of the month.

          It's been a few days now since I received the coding task from the
          company. Today I decided to work on it more and add some things that I
          didn't add before. I haven't heard back from them, and I don't know if
          I will. I'm thinking about following up tomorrow. With each passing
          day, it seems the odds of getting the job get slimmer.

          The feeling of accomplishing goals is wonderful. I need to keep doing
          that. Working on the coding task made me feel that way. Even if it
          doesn't amount to anything, it is a net benefit to my life. It can
          help me with future tasks.

          Sometimes I wonder about the benefits of walking. It's not about the
          walking per se. It's about exerting effort. It's about struggling.
          It's about getting out of the house and seeing the world. It's about
          getting outside of my comfort zone. I like the consistency. It's a
          daily thing now, and I like it. I've missed a few days since I've
          started for various reasons, but I try to go daily. It's a habit now.
          I don't have to force myself to do it. I have to keep growing though.
          I have to push further. In time, I hope to do just that.
