          Despite having work, I've been trying to still get 10k steps in daily,
          and so far, I've been successful. I do some in the morning and some at
          night. Today's Friday, so no work. Today is the only day we get off in
          the week.

          I need to start reading more. I want to finish 'Getting Things Done'.
          That's my book for this month. It seems appealing. I believe this is
          the book where the 2-minute rule came from if I'm not mistaken.

          I went to a cousin's place today. They have two young kids, and it was
          nice interacting with them. I was more communicative than usual. I
          guess I'm getting better.
