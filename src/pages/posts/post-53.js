          In the morning, I did some shopping, and in the afternoon, I went to
          Global Village, so I was out for most of the day. That alone got my
          step count to over 10,000, which was nice because I didn't have to
          walk more afterward.

          I've been to Global Village so many times. I've seen it grow and go
          through a lot of changes. There are pavilions for each country that
          contain several stores that sell items from those countries. There are
          also unique performances which are nice to see. I enjoyed watching the
          Africans perform because they performed with a lot of passion. I
          admired seeing them have pride in their traditions.

          As a chess nerd, the different chess sets from the various countries
          stood out to me. Years ago, I received a marble set from the Pakistan
          pavilion. I loved that gift.

          We walked quite a lot and bought a few things. On the way back, we
          picked up some KFC and had it once we got home.

        <p>It was a nice day.</p>
