          Squid Game. What a show. I started last night and finished a little
          while ago. I had to force myself to sleep because I had an interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought the interview went really well. I established good rapport
          and it was a nice conversation. I was pretty nervous and could sense
          my voice shaking but I'm not sure if they could. I was able to compose
          myself.

          It was with the CEO and their lead developer I believe. The developer
          was very nice and she seemed satisfied with my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CEO thought maybe I wasn't the best fit for the role but was
          definitely open to bringing me on board in some capacity. He said he'd
          need to consult with the team and then get back to me.
        </p>

          I got my 10k steps in today as well. My back was aching in the
          beginning. I assumed it was from the way I was lying down before the
          walk while watching Squid Game. I walked through the pain and it went
          away. It's fascinating how that works. I listened to the Can't Hurt Me
          audiobook during the walk. It's pretty good.
        </p>
        <p>
          No work on projects today. Today was Squid Game, interview, and
          walking. I feel like my confidence is rising and my people skills are
          getting better. Perhaps I am capable of achieving great things after
          all. We'll have to wait and see.
