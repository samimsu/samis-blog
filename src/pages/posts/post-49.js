          I figured instead of beating myself up over missed opportunities, I
          could look on the bright side, and take away some positives. Although
          the company hasn't responded to my latest emails, our conversations
          during the interviews were quite pleasant, and I'd like to reflect on
          them.
        </p>

          While I was initially applying for the Frontend Developer position, I
          had to make a video for my application. That would have prevented old
          me from applying, because it would have been too scary to do. But
          lately, I've wanted to connect sincerely with more people. I want to
          improve my communication skills. I want to prove my worth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turns out that video was a huge selling point for me. The CEO liked
          that video, and it's what stood out to him. I still cringe sometimes
          watching it back, but I'm glad I made it.
        </p>

          He also mentioned that I didn't seem to be the best fit, but he
          definitely saw a role for me that could help with my personal growth.
          I loved that he said that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The developer that was also on the call for the interview said she
          just wanted a good teammate. I think we established a good rapport,
          and I liked her. She thought my projects were fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CEO also liked the fact that I had done some freelance work that I
          was paid for.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          So overall, there were a lot of positives from that interview, and all
          I needed to do next was the coding task. Unfortunately, I didn't
          receive any feedback about it, so I assume it wasn't good enough,
          which is a shame.{" "}

          The quote at the beginning of this post is a quote I often think
          about, because it puts the onus on me. Instead of blaming outside
          factors for not getting my way, I should do everything I can to be as
          good as I can be. That is my goal. I want to make something of myself
          and improve my skills to the point where they can no longer be
          ignored. I want to be great.
        </p>
        <p>
          P.S. I applied for a few jobs today. It's nice looking at
          opportunities and feeling like I am a good fit. I often used to feel
          like I wouldn't be good enough, but today I didn't feel that way.
