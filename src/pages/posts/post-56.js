          Thank god for free wifi. I'm at Zahia City Centre so that I can get
          this post up. I still want to maintain the daily posting streak for a
          while longer. We lost power at home, so that's why I'm here. This
          place is my stop for my walk today. I've walked about 4k steps. I
          should reach 10k by the time I get home.

          This mall is quite nice. I'm sitting facing the restaurants at the
          food court. I like the prayer area too at this mall. It's pretty big.
          I'll try to get this up before prayer time, pray and then finish up my
          walk.

          I kind of liked losing power earlier. The internet can be such a
          distraction. It was nice to get a break from it. It allowed me to
          think about stuff. I have a potential idea for a future post. I've
          written some notes about it. It's more personal, but I like it. I like
          sharing. I want to connect with others. It's difficult to do
          face-to-face, but maybe I can connect through my writing.

          I also got the opportunity to read. I started reading Getting Things
          Done by David Allen. It looks really interesting so far. It might be
          my book for the month. I'll read a bit more and then see how I feel.

          No headphones on my walk today. I want to try walking without it now
          since I've finished my audiobook. I like thinking about stuff. I also
          like talking out loud. It seems a bit funny to me, but I find it
          enjoyable and therapeutic. Perhaps it can help me resolve some
          internal conflicts if I can clarify what they are out loud.

          It's a new month, and it's time for new goals. Reading at least one
          book is a goal. I'm going to try and do some coding as well. I'll
          probably share more specifically what my goals were, and give an
          update at the end of the month, as I have been for the past two
          months. Of course, getting a job is also a huge priority. Let's see
          how I do this month.
