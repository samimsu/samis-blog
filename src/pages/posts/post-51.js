          I need to fix my sleeping pattern. I need to wake up sooner. It used
          to be better, and now it's back to not good enough. I feel a lot
          better when I'm up earlier.

          I should finish my two books for this month before the month is over.
          The two books are No Rules Rules and Can't Hurt Me. I have less than 2
          hours of Can't Hurt Me left. I should finish No Rules Rules tomorrow
          or the day after. We'll see.

          I went on my 10k steps walk today as usual. This time I went to Zahia
          City Center and prayed there and then walked home. Usually, I don't go
          in, but today, I started late, so it was getting close to sunset when
          I got close.
        </p>

          I'm enjoying the walks for the most part. I need more time alone with
          my thoughts instead of listening to something, so maybe I'll try that
          when I finish the audiobook. I'd also like to reflect on the walks so
          far and look at the stats. I'll probably share that in a future post.

          Social media is still a bit of an addiction for me. I'm in a cycle of
          deleting apps, then redownloading them, then deleting, and so on. Even
          when I don't have the apps, I still go on through the website, which
          is not as bad because I can't be distracted by notifications. This
          way, I consciously have to decide to visit the websites.
        </p>

          Hopefully, once I get a job, this problem will be reduced or go away.
          But to get a job, I need to keep this in check and focus on applying.
