          This post will be up earlier than usual since I will probably be out
          until pretty late. We're going to visit a cousin, and I don't know if
          I will be back before midnight or have the energy to write a post. I
          will probably miss out on walking too.

          I ran a few errands in the morning. It was nice to drive again. I
          don't get to do that often. It was pretty dangerous without a side
          mirror. We'll get that fixed soon.

          I read a bit more of No Rules Rules. It's a compelling read. I think
          it goes against traditional wisdom about how to run a company
          effectively. Netflix has been incredibly successful, so they've earned
          the right to talk about radical company policies. The employees also
          seem to like working there.

          So far, the principles have sounded appealing to me. It's about
          concentrating talent and reducing control over them. It's about having
          as few policies as possible. I like the sound of that.
