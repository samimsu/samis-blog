          It's hard writing sometimes. Especially when you're struggling with
          everything else. It's all mental. My head's not in the 'game'. I need
          to be doing more. I've been pretty distracted. I'm glad I finished a
          book, and I'm close to finishing a second one for this month, but I'm
          lagging behind on the main thing, and that is getting a job.

          I did my 10k steps walk today and listened to more of the Can't Hurt
          Me audiobook. I sometimes lose focus. At this point, I'm just trying
          to get it finished as soon as possible. It's a good book about David
          Goggins' life, and he sets several challenges for the readers to do to
          try and get them to improve their lives. His story is quite inspiring,
          and he breaks down what it takes to achieve greatness.

          For the most part, it's just about mindset. We have to toughen our
          minds so that we can overcome whatever life decides to throw our way.
          We should welcome struggle and use it to fuel us. I've been trying
          that, but lately, I feel like I've been slipping. I've been giving in
          to the instant gratification monkey.

          It feels a bit self-defeating when you feel like you've tried a lot
          but are not seeing any results. That's how I feel about job hunting,
          but then again, I could be doing more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not going to lose hope. I can't wait for the day when I can post
          about getting a job. I know it shouldn't be this hard. This is another
          thing that can be easily achieved with the right mindset.
