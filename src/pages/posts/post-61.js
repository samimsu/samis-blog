          It's harder to keep up these posts with a job. Who knew a job would
          take up most of your time? It's alright. I hope this job goes well.
          I've been trying.

          I don't think I'll be able to make 10k steps today. It's alright,
          though. It's taking me longer to get this post done because the TV is
          on in the background.

          I haven't been reading either. I don't know if I'll reach all my goals
          this month. At least I got the main one done. I hope I can keep hold
          of this job and not get too overwhelmed by it.

          I had a decent day today too. I managed to get a sale in by the end of
          the day. I make dozens and dozens of calls, and I'm lucky if I make a
          sale.

          It's a fascinating experience, though. An interesting chapter for my
          life. I'm glad I'm getting some sales experience. I know salespeople
          can be pretty annoying, so I understand when potential clients get
          annoyed with us. I try to be as nice as possible. Some people just
          hang up in the middle of the conversation. It's a cool learning
          experience.
