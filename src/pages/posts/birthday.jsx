          I turned 28 today. We had pizza hut for lunch yesterday which is
          always nice and had cake with dinner today. Ronaldo gave me a great
          gift. He's been an inspiration of mine for a very long time. I look up
          to him immensely like a lot of people. I was so happy he got 2 goals
          today. Also happy for Bruno but especially Lingard. He has battled
          with mental health issues and I admire his comeback. I hope he can
          keep going.

          I didn't want to break my daily posting streak just yet because of my
          birthday. It's less than 2 hours until the next day so I'll try to get
          this up as soon as possible. It's a bit short and rushed. I expect to
          have a few of these posts.

          I'm still trying to figure out what sort of content to have on here.
          Maybe something educational or interesting. I have a bunch of
          different ideas floating around. Mostly I just want to document my
          life. So far it's been pretty ordinary but I hope I can do something
          substantial eventually.

          There's probably a lot of time until that happens and I guess I'll
          document the journey as much as I can.{' '}
