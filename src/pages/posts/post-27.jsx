        <p>
          The drive to do anything has been pretty low lately. I still stumble
          along with a few things, but I just don't feel great. I managed to
          walk 10k steps today after skipping a few days, which is a plus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I miss the feeling I had when I moved here about six months ago. I was
          excited and motivated. I participated in a chess tournament within a
          couple of days I reckon and had a few good interviews early on. Things
          seemed like they were falling in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          But with time, I've drifted back into what comes easy to me - the
          reserved approach to everything. The more time goes on, the less
          optimistic I get. Sometimes I get moments that make me hopeful, only
          to be disappointed once more.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorry for being a downer, so instead of going on and on about it, I'll
          leave it here. Let's hope for better days.
