        <p>
          Today I had a speed coaching meetup on zoom. I was a client and I had
          2 15 minute sessions with two different coaches. I've attended a few
          of these weekly meetups, and it always gives me a good boost. I hadn't
          attended in a while, so it was nice to get back to it. They're always
          looking for more coaches and clients, so you could [sign up](link) if
          you'd like.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I talked about my job hunt with my coaches because getting a job is my
          number one priority. Sometimes I lose focus, feel defeated, and think
          I'll never get one. At the moment, I feel different. I feel hopeful. I
          often fluctuate between these two states. I'm hoping that blogging
          about it and looking back over it will make it easier to stay on
          track.
        </p>
        <p>
          My coaches were also very helpful on that front. I told them that one
          of my biggest hurdles was procrastination. My first coach talked to me
          about the Pomodoro Technique, which I've heard of but never really
          implemented. I'm going to look into it more. I like that I'll have to
          separate work time and break time. I often don't make a clear
          distinction. Now I'll have to clarify what qualifies as work.
        </p>
        <p>
          My second coach was probably my favorite coach yet. He asked the right
          questions, which showed he was picking up on what I was saying. I told
          him about my low confidence and not feeling worthy of a job. It would
          technically be my first real job, so he provided advice specifically
          for that. He said that getting the first job is the hardest, so I
          should apply for anything, and then it will be easier to get that
          second job. I need to lower my expectations and take whatever I can
          get. That puts less pressure on the job hunt, so I like that. So
          that's what I've been doing today - applying for random jobs that I
          usually wouldn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also shared my living situation with him and how perhaps I was
          lacking urgency because of it. He asked about what I found appealing
          about a job, and I half-jokingly said not much. Then I talked about
          how having some money would be good and working in a nice environment
          doing enjoyable work would also be appealing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shared how he performed an experiment with a group of unemployed
          people and how he helped them get a job. They gathered in a circle and
          cut out job postings from a newspaper. They would hand the posting to
          a neighbor who would have to apply for that job. I'm not sure how
          often they gathered, but the participant applied for several jobs. I
          believe at around three weeks, most if not all of them had gotten a
          job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was blown away by that, but it makes complete sense. What they
          needed and what I need, is a job. Not my dream job but <em>a</em> job.
          You have to work your way up, and that is the way it should be. I
          can't skip a few steps no matter how much I'd like to. If I'm starting
          late in my career, that's on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope I can carry this optimism through the week and get more
          interviews. It's been about six months since I came to this country. I
          think it's high time my life turned around.
