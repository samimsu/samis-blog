          This post will be the 29th post in a row. I haven't missed a day since
          I've started. I wonder how long I can go.
        </p>

          I spoke to an old friend today on the phone after a long time. I
          always like talking to him. He's one of my dearest friends and he's
          always really nice to me. I'm lucky to know him.
        </p>
        <p>
          We got a chance to catch up and talk about where we were at in our
          lives. He had some advice for me for my job hunt, which was
          considerate. I appreciated that.
        </p>

          He moved to New Zealand a few years ago, so it's been a while since
          I've seen him. I hope I will someday.

          I made some updates to{" "}
          <a href="https://simplechat-demo.netlify.app/">SimpleChat</a>. Now you
          can only delete your messages, whereas before, anyone could delete
          anyone else's messages. I've also added a username feature so now each
          message also includes the username of the person who sent it.
        </p>

          I managed to get at least 10,000 steps in today as well. I didn't
          listen to anything on my walk because my earphones stopped working.
          That could be a good thing. I'm sure there's some benefit to just
          being alone with my thoughts.

          I see different groups of kids playing football, and it makes me miss
          playing. It's been a while. I also wish there was a system in place to
          find talent in this country and give them a platform. There isn't
          really one.

          I want to read A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy.
          I've started a bit, but I'm not sure if it will be one of the books
          for this month. The second book I'm considering is Can't Hurt Me by
          David Goggins. I need to make reading a habit and find a good time to
          do it. Maybe I could start my days with reading. I'll think about it.
        </p>

          I'm still hoping to hear back from the companies I interviewed for.
          It's just been a day or two, and they said that I may hear back within
          a week, so I'm patiently waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that's what's up with me. I hope I have a pleasant day tomorrow as
          well.
