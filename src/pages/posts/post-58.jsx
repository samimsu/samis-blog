          So I had an interview today for a telesales job, and I got started
          right away. I didn't make any calls yet. I was learning about the
          product we're selling, studying the script and the recordings of calls
          our salespeople have already made. I notice I get easily overwhelmed.
          I'm trying to overcome that. It's a bit like the first day of school.
          I assume it will get easier. I have to channel the David Goggins
          inside me. Push through adversity.

          It's not that bad though. It's just my own mental state. The manager
          is really nice. I love his charisma and charm. He's good at building
          morale. We ended the day with a game called 'mafia'. Earlier, he asked
          me if I could do some coding for the company's CRM platform. I felt a
          little out of my depth, but I said I could do some research and let
          him know.
        </p>

          I got 3k steps in before I left for the interview, so that was nice.
          It helped me think about the day and how I'd handle it. I think I did
          okay, but I did feel a little overwhelmed, as I said. I haven't
          reached 10k steps yet. I have a few hundred more to go. I'll get this
          post up, go down and walk a little. I'm trying to get it all done
          before midnight, which I should be able to.
        </p>

          Then perhaps I could study the script that I'll need to reference
          during my sales calls. This job is a little outside my comfort zone,
          but that's good. That's where growth comes from. I hope I can do good
          and surprise even myself.
