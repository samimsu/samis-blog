          This post was going to be me sulking about being unemployed until I
          got a phone call that raised my spirits a little bit. It was for a job
          opportunity. I felt like the call went well, and he told me what he
          found compelling about me. That was nice to hear. I'm expecting a call
          in a few days for a follow-up, and then perhaps they'll ask me to meet
          them at their office.

        <p>This is what I was going to say before I got the call:</p>

            Sometimes I wonder if I'm even cut out for job hunting. The pressure
            of standing out amongst the competition is not easy to bear. I look
            at the number of other people who have applied for the same job, and
            I don't believe there's any way I could beat all of them. If I'm
            never the best candidate out of dozens of applicants, how can I ever
            get a job?

          I believe that statement is still accurate, but those thoughts are not
          at the top of my mind right now. It truly is a numbers game as they
          say, and you just have to keep going. Quitting is not an option, and
          nor should the constant breaks I take from applying for jobs be. It
          should be a daily occurrence. It just drains me a little bit and can
          be pretty stressful. I want to adopt a tougher mindset. I want to be
          someone who can withstand setbacks. I suppose that's why I've been
          listening to more David Goggins lately.

          I started applying for jobs here about six months ago when I arrived
          in the UAE. My job search has included overseas jobs as well as local
          ones. I just wanted to try everything. Early on, I had an interview
          with Cobblestone Energy, and I enjoyed the process. There were many
          stages I got through until I got to a coding stage which I didn't
          pass. It was frustrating to get so far but fall short. It was a good
          experience nonetheless.

          After a few rejections, I decided to try out a program that involved
          creating a web app. It was a work simulation organized by{" "}
          <a href="https://www.hatchways.io">Hatchways</a>. I figured that if I
          worked on a project with a team, I'd be better prepared for when I
          eventually got a tech job. It was a fun and rewarding experience. They
          also help with job hunting based on how well you do in the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently, I had multiple interviews with{" "}
          <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a>. The initial coding challenge
          went well, and the initial call was nice, but I didn't pass the
          follow-up coding challenge. It was a live coding session, and the code
          passed most of the tests, but I guess under the pressure of the
          interview, I was unable to pass the remaining tests. I went back after
          the interview to redo the challenge and passed all the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the number of applications I"ve sent over the past few months, I
          haven't gotten very many interviews. I guess my profile wasn't strong
          enough to get to that stage. I also think that because of the sheer
          volume of applications, mine was simply missed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another approach I tried was reaching out to recruiters. I didn't hear
          back from all of them. There was someone who offered a paid program to
          improve my profile, but I couldn't afford it. There was another that
          reached out for another opportunity, but I didn't hear back. I suppose
          I wasn't the best fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm trying not to set my expectations too high for the new job
          opportunity. I'll try to do my best throughout the process and
          continue to look for other positions in the meantime.
