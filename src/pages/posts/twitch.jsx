          Ever since I quit YouTube a few months ago, I've found myself
          consuming content from various other sources. Lately, it's been Twitch
          and mostly chess streamers.
        </p>
        <p>
          It feels like a different world than YouTube. It's live and more
          interactive. You get to talk with some of the streamers, and I can see
          how that can become an addiction. You get to see a more real side of a
          person, or so it seems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've done a few streams myself. At the moment, I don't get to talk to
          many people but the few times that I have it's been quite nice. It was
          a way to come out of my shell a little bit and build my confidence.
          It's not quite public speaking, but it's a good starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watching streams can be quite a time suck though, but I would say less
          than YouTube for me. Maybe it's just that I've gotten to the point
          where I'm more aware of how I'm spending my time. Then again, I think
          YouTube is designed to be more addictive by keeping users as engaged
          as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to stream chess once I get a job. I don't want to lose focus on
          what's more important right now, and that is making a living.
          Although, one can argue I haven't been focused enough if I've gone
          this many months without landing a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been applying constantly like a lot of people do. I guess I need
          to tweak my process more for it to bring better results. I'll work on
          that, and I still have hope that something will work out.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's all for now. I wanted to get a quick post up because we're
          going out for dinner soon. Usually, I post close to midnight, but I
          didn't think I'd be able to today. I hope I'm able to change my post
          schedule to earlier in the day so that I'm not always cutting it
          close.
