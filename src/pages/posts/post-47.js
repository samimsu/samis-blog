          It's been over seven months since I returned to the UAE, and I still
          haven't found a job. I haven't even been applying lately, because I'm
          pinning all my hopes on this one opportunity. I still haven't heard
          back after I emailed them my coding task. I'll put that down to it
          being the weekend. I hope by the end of tomorrow I'll get a response.
          If not, I guess it's back to applying again.

          I watched Bo Burnham's Netflix special, Inside, yesterday. I really
          liked it. It showed some of his mental health struggles during the
          lockdown. I never felt that struggle because of covid. I was in
          Pakistan when it started, and I was already someone who stayed indoors
          all day, so I couldn't relate to people who were struggling with it. I
          had all the entertainment I needed on my phone and laptop. I was also
          unemployed and had been for a while by then. I was used to staying in
          my room all day and being unproductive. I liked being lazy for the
          most part. Of course, I had moments where I felt like a loser who was
          throwing his life away. I always pushed that thought away with more
          YouTube and TV shows and movies.

          Ever since I came back to this country, I've been trying to change.
          I'm trying to be more productive and more serious about my future. I
          want to do something substantial with my life instead of wasting away.
          I want to push myself. I want to test my limits. The daily walks are a
          step in that direction. These daily blog posts are also a part of that
          greater ambition.

          How do people run marathons? It seems incredibly difficult. It's not
          impossible. If I work hard, I'll be able to do it. I also questioned
          how people could walk 10k steps daily, and now I'm one of those
          people. Being unemployed helps me find the time to walk that much
          daily.

          I got an email today about a sale that was extended. I detest sales
          tactics. I detest phony discounts. I detest limited-time offers. I
          often get emails about discounts on things like coding courses or an
          account upgrade. They always advertise it as a limited-time offer, and
          then almost always they extend the time. I do not like that at all.
          It's manipulative. They want you to feel the urgency and buy right
          away, so they set an arbitrary time limit but then extend it.

          That's it for my mini-rant. I hope I hear back from that company
          tomorrow. If not, I have to work harder. There's a lot more I can do.
